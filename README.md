# IJC_0699
Code for simulating the navigation of three unicycles through a narrow passing before stabilizing themselves, 
under the presence of bounded additive disturbances, via Model Predictive Control. The problem formulation and its theoretical 
proof of solution can be found at https://github.com/li9i/KTH_thesis_report
